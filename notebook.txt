- High
- Low

- Volume

OBJECTIVES
Primary: Predict a significant fluctuation (rise) in price for the day
Secondary: Predict a series of fluctuations (rise)  in price for a few days

TRIALS
1. Test correlation between volumes and returns.
2. Is the pattern before the high volume learnable?

GAP UP/DOWN ANALYSIS
- Four types of gaps - common gap, breakaway gap, continuation gap, exhaustion gap
- Full gap is when the next day's price is higher than the high of the prev day
- Breakaway gaps occur at the end of a price pattern, and indicate a new trend or direction
- Exhaustion gaps represents the final leg of a price pattern, and an indicator of a final attempt to reach the new
  high/lows in the pricing. Indicates reversal of patterns
- Common gap represents the area of price gap, and tells the square area within which strategies can be applied
- Continuation gap which occurs in the middle of a pattern, indicates common belief on the direction of the stock
- Difference between breakaway gap and exhaustion gap is volume (high vs. low)
- * Once a stock starts to fill a gap, it will not stop *

Strat 1 (Intraday)
- If gap down occurs, and price hits opening price, buy for high chance of gap closure

Strat 2
- Find breakaway gaps to confirm trends

Strat 3*
- Try and predict gap ups
